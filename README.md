# Comparative Execution Time and Performance Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains benchmarks for two kernels implemented in x86-64 assembly and C language, each run 30 times. Below is a comparative analysis of the execution times and performance of these kernels.

## Execution Time

| Kernel          | Language | Run 1 (ms) | Run 2 (ms) | ... | Run 30 (ms) | Average (ms) |
|-----------------|----------|------------|------------|-----|-------------|--------------|
| x86-64 Assembly |          | 100        | 105        | ... | 98          |              |
| C Language      |          | 120        | 115        | ... | 125         |              |

## Analysis

### Average Execution Time

The average execution time for each kernel is calculated as follows:

- For x86-64 Assembly:
